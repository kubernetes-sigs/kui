# Expandable Sections

Sections starting with a `??? tip "Section name"` will be rendered
as an expandable section, with the tab content indented by at least
4 spaces.

??? tip "Example Expandable Section"

    **Warning**: due to the vagaries of the Markdown syntax, make
    sure to have a newline separating the section start and section
    content.

???+ tip "Example Expandable Section (default expanded)"

    With the added `+` (as in `???+`), the expandable section will
    be initially expanded.
