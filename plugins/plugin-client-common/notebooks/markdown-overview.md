Kui interprets and displays markdown source. Kui has special
interpretation for a some of the common bits of markdown syntax,
allowing you to author:

- [Executable code blocks](#code-blocks) that
  provide sample output, and let the user re-execute the code in their
  context
- [Hints](#hints), using markdown blockquotes
- [Expandable Sections](#expandable-sections), using syntax adopted
  from [pymdown's Details
  extension](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/details/)
- [Icons](#icons), using familiar colon-delimeted syntax :rocket:
- [Tabs](#tabs), using syntax adopted from [pymdown's Tabbed
  extension](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/tabbed/)
