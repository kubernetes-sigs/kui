# An Example that offers the user a Choice

A guidebook is a **markdown** file, written with a bit of care so that it can be automatically processed into a **wizard** experience. What you are seeing here on the right is the wizard that was automatically generated from the markdown source on the left. Try editing the source! Look [here](#kuiexec?command=replay%20/kui/playground.md) for examples of supported syntax. :rocket:

=== "Option A"
    Description for ${choice}.
    ```shell
    echo You chose ${choice}
    ```

=== "Option B"
    Description for ${choice}.
    ```shell
    echo You chose ${choice}
    ```
