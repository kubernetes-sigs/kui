# Knative

[Knative]((https://knative.dev)) is enterprise-grade Serverless on
your own terms, a Kubernetes-based platform to deploy and manage
modern serverless workloads.

Knative components build on top of
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), abstracting away the complex
details and enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by
codifying the best practices shared by successful real-world
implementations, Knative solves the "boring but difficult" parts of
deploying and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.
