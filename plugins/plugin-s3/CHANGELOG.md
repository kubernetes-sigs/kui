### BREAKING CHANGES

* this removes some of the exported pretty printers from kui-shell/core
* with this PR, the aws s3 mount points are of the form `/s3/aws/default` and `/s3/aws/myOtherProfile`. Any logic that was hard-coding an expectation that `/s3/aws/mybucket` would work must now specify the profile explicitly e.g. `/s3/aws/default/mybucket`

Also, neither the aws config/credentials nor the `aws` CLI support encoding the endpoint url in a config file. See https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1270

Lacking this support, for now, this PR assumes that, if needed, a profile's `endpoint_url` is a config key with that name in the `config` file, e.g.

```conf
[default]
endpoint_url=https://my-s3-server.com
...
```
* this PR removes plugins from the repo

### BREAKING CHANGES

* this removes some of the exported pretty printers from kui-shell/core
* with this PR, the aws s3 mount points are of the form `/s3/aws/default` and `/s3/aws/myOtherProfile`. Any logic that was hard-coding an expectation that `/s3/aws/mybucket` would work must now specify the profile explicitly e.g. `/s3/aws/default/mybucket`

Also, neither the aws config/credentials nor the `aws` CLI support encoding the endpoint url in a config file. See https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1270

Lacking this support, for now, this PR assumes that, if needed, a profile's `endpoint_url` is a config key with that name in the `config` file, e.g.

```conf
[default]
endpoint_url=https://my-s3-server.com
...
```
* this PR removes plugins from the repo
