# AnimalApp: A Demo Client for the Kui Graphical CLI Framework

If you would like to extend Kui, check out [this
repo](https://github.com/kui-shell/AnimalApp) for a starting
point. You can clone that repository, which consumes Kui via npm
modules. This gives you more granular control of which, and which
versions, of the core Kui plugins you want to include in your custom
client.
